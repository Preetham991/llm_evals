## 2. Theoretical Foundations of Confidence Evaluation

### 2.1 Mathematical Framework

#### 2.1.1 Formal Problem Definition

Let $X$ be the input space (emails/documents), $Y = \{0,1\}^K$ be the multi-label output space for $K$ labels, and $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be our LLM classifier. For each input $x_i$, the model produces:

- **Predicted labels:** $\hat{y}_i = [\hat{y}_{i1}, ..., \hat{y}_{iK}]$ where $\hat{y}_{ik} \in \{0,1\}$
- **Raw scores:** $s_i = [s_{i1}, ..., s_{iK}]$ where $s_{ik} \in \mathbb{R}$
- **Confidence scores:** $c_i = [c_{i1}, ..., c_{iK}]$ where \$c_{ik} \in \$

The fundamental goal is to ensure that $c_{ik}$ accurately reflects $P(\hat{y}_{ik} = y_{ik})$, the probability that the predicted label matches the true label.

#### 2.1.2 Information-Theoretic Foundations

**Entropy and Uncertainty:**
The Shannon entropy of the predicted label distribution provides a natural measure of model uncertainty:

$$
H(p_i) = -\sum_{k=1}^{K} p_{ik} \log p_{ik}
$$

where $p_{ik}$ represents the probability assigned to label $k$ for sample $i$.

**Mutual Information:**
The relationship between model predictions and true labels can be quantified through mutual information:

$$
I(Y; \hat{Y}) = \sum_{y,\hat{y}} P(y,\hat{y}) \log \frac{P(y,\hat{y})}{P(y)P(\hat{y})}
$$

Higher mutual information indicates better alignment between predictions and ground truth.

#### 2.1.3 Proper Scoring Rules

Confidence evaluation relies heavily on proper scoring rules, which provide unbiased estimates of predictive quality. A scoring rule $S(p, y)$ is proper if it is maximized in expectation when $p$ equals the true probability distribution.

**Key Properties:**

- **Incentive Compatibility:** Optimal strategy is to report true beliefs
- **Decomposability:** Can be analyzed in terms of calibration and sharpness
- **Strict Properness:** Unique maximum at true probability


### 2.2 Calibration Theory

#### 2.2.1 Perfect Calibration Definition

A confidence function \$c: X \rightarrow \$ is perfectly calibrated if:

$$
P(Y = 1 | c(X) = p) = p \quad \forall p \in
$$

This means that among all predictions with confidence $p$, exactly proportion $p$ should be correct.

#### 2.2.2 Reliability-Resolution-Uncertainty Decomposition

The Brier score can be decomposed as:

$$
BS = \text{Reliability} - \text{Resolution} + \text{Uncertainty}
$$

where:

- **Reliability:** Measures calibration quality (lower is better)
- **Resolution:** Measures ability to discriminate (higher is better)
- **Uncertainty:** Inherent difficulty of the prediction task


#### 2.2.3 Multi-Label Calibration Challenges

Multi-label scenarios introduce additional complexity:

1. **Label Dependencies:** Labels may be correlated, violating independence assumptions
2. **Marginal vs. Joint Calibration:** Individual label calibration may not ensure joint calibration
3. **Class Imbalance:** Rare labels may have insufficient data for reliable calibration

### 2.3 Uncertainty Quantification Framework

#### 2.3.1 Types of Uncertainty

**Aleatoric Uncertainty (Data Uncertainty):**

- Inherent noise in the data
- Cannot be reduced with more data
- Captured through distributional modeling

**Epistemic Uncertainty (Model Uncertainty):**

- Uncertainty due to limited training data
- Can potentially be reduced with more data
- Captured through ensemble methods or Bayesian approaches


#### 2.3.2 Bayesian Perspective

From a Bayesian viewpoint, confidence should reflect the posterior probability:

$$
P(y|x, \mathcal{D}) = \int P(y|x, \theta) P(\theta|\mathcal{D}) d\theta
$$

where $\theta$ represents model parameters and $\mathcal{D}$ is the training data.

## 3. Agreement Labels: The Foundation of Empirical Evaluation

### 3.1 Binary Agreement (Ground Truth vs Prediction)

#### 3.1.1 Formal Definition and Properties

For each predicted label $l_k$ on sample $i$, the binary agreement signal is:

$$
a_{ik} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \hat{y}_{ik} = y_{ik} \text{ (exact match)} \\
0 & \text{if } \hat{y}_{ik} \neq y_{ik} \text{ (disagreement)}
\end{cases}
$$

**Mathematical Properties:**

- **Deterministic:** Each prediction has a definite correct/incorrect status
- **Symmetric:** All errors are weighted equally regardless of label or context
- **Transitive:** Agreement with ground truth implies consistency across evaluators


#### 3.1.2 Theoretical Foundations

Binary agreement serves as the foundation for:

- **Proper Scoring Rules:** Brier score, logarithmic score, and their variants
- **Calibration Analysis:** Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and reliability diagrams
- **Discrimination Metrics:** ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall curves
- **Statistical Inference:** Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals


#### 3.1.3 Implementation Considerations

**Data Quality Requirements:**

- Clean, unambiguous ground truth labels
- Consistent annotation protocols across datasets
- Version control for label updates and corrections

**Computational Efficiency:**

- O(1) computation per prediction
- Memory-efficient storage as binary arrays
- Vectorizable operations for batch processing


#### 3.1.4 Use Cases and Applications

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Regulatory compliance requiring clear pass/fail criteria
- Automated systems with well-defined decision boundaries
- Benchmark comparisons across different models or methods
- A/B testing for model performance evaluation

**Limitations:**

- Cannot capture label uncertainty or annotator disagreement
- May oversimplify complex classification scenarios
- Sensitive to ground truth quality and consistency


### 3.2 Partial/Soft Agreement (Annotator Consensus)

#### 3.2.1 Mathematical Formulation

For scenarios with multiple annotators or sources of truth:

$$
a_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{J} \mathbb{I}[\text{annotator}_j \text{ agrees with prediction}]}{J}
$$

where $J$ is the total number of annotators and $\mathbb{I}[\cdot]$ is the indicator function.

**Generalized Weighting:**

$$
a_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{J} w_j \cdot \mathbb{I}[\text{annotator}_j \text{ agrees with prediction}]}{\sum_{j=1}^{J} w_j}
$$

where $w_j$ represents the reliability weight of annotator $j$.

**Theoretical Advantages:**

- **Noise Robustness:** Reduces impact of individual annotator errors
- **Statistical Properties:** More stable estimates with larger annotator pools
- **Extension of Binary Metrics:** Natural generalization to soft targets


#### 3.2.2 Theoretical Foundations

Partial agreement addresses the reality of label noise and subjective judgment in real-world annotation tasks. It connects to robust learning theory and crowd-sourcing methodologies, enabling more nuanced calibration for ambiguous cases.

#### 3.2.3 Implementation Considerations

**Annotation Collection:**

- Minimum 3-5 annotators per sample for reliable estimates
- Quality control mechanisms for annotator performance
- Conflict resolution protocols for extreme disagreement

**Aggregation Methods:**

- Simple majority voting with tie-breaking rules
- Weighted voting based on annotator expertise or past performance
- Probabilistic models (e.g., Dawid-Skene) for latent ground truth estimation


#### 3.2.4 Use Cases and Applications

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Subjective or ambiguous labeling tasks
- Crowd-sourced annotation projects
- Systems requiring uncertainty quantification beyond model confidence
- Research investigating annotator disagreement patterns

**Limitations:**

- Requires multiple annotations per sample
- Computationally more expensive than binary agreement
- May introduce bias if annotators are not representative


### 3.3 Integration in Evaluation Pipeline

#### 3.3.1 Preprocessing Requirements

**Data Validation:**

- Consistency checks across annotation sources
- Missing value handling and imputation strategies
- Quality metrics for annotation reliability

**Normalization:**

- Scale partial agreements to  range
- Handle edge cases (zero annotators, perfect disagreement)
- Ensure compatibility with downstream metrics


#### 3.3.2 Metric Adaptation

**Modified Scoring Rules:**
All classical metrics extend naturally to partial agreement:

- **Brier Score:** $BS = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (c_i - a_i)^2$ where \$a_i \in \$
- **Calibration Error:** Bin by confidence and compare to mean partial agreement
- **Discrimination:** Use partial agreement as continuous target for AUC calculation


#### 3.3.3 Visualization Adaptation

**Agreement Grouping:**

- Category 1: Full agreement (a_i = 1)
- Category 2: Partial agreement (0 < a_i < 1)
- Category 3: No agreement (a_i = 0)

**Multi-Dimensional Views:**

- Color gradients for partial agreement values
- Density plots for continuous agreement distributions
- Faceted plots for different agreement thresholds


#### 3.3.4 Theoretical Justification for Dual Agreement Systems

Using both binary and partial agreement provides a more complete picture of model performance:

- **Binary Agreement:** Focuses on definitive correctness
- **Partial Agreement:** Captures nuance and uncertainty
- **Combined Analysis:** Enables robust evaluation across different scenarios

This dual approach aligns with modern robust learning theory and provides better generalization to real-world deployment.

## 4. Comprehensive Confidence Score Generation Methods

### 4.1 Probabilistic and Logit-Based Methods

#### 4.1.1 Raw Logprobs: Foundation Method

**Mathematical Definition:**
For a sequence of tokens $w_1, ..., w_T$ representing a label:

$$
\text{RawLogprob}(l) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log P(w_t | w_{<t}, x)
$$

**Theoretical Properties:**

- **Monotonicity:** Higher values indicate stronger model belief
- **Additivity:** Natural aggregation across token sequences
- **Scale Sensitivity:** Raw values depend on vocabulary and sequence length

**When Most Relevant:**

- Initial baseline assessment of model confidence
- Diagnostic analysis of attention patterns and token-level uncertainty
- Comparative studies across different model architectures
- Research into fundamental properties of language model confidence


#### 4.1.2 Normalized Logprobs: Length-Adjusted Confidence

**Length Normalization:**

$$
\text{NormLogprob}(l) = \frac{\text{RawLogprob}(l)}{T}
$$

**Perplexity-Based Normalization:**

$$
\text{PPL-NormLogprob}(l) = \exp\left(-\frac{\text{RawLogprob}(l)}{T}\right)
$$

**Advanced Normalization Strategies:**

- **Information Content:** Normalize by expected information content of label
- **Vocabulary Adjustment:** Account for vocabulary size effects
- **Position-Dependent:** Weight tokens by their position importance

**Empirical Validation:**
Studies show normalized logprobs provide more consistent confidence estimates across:

- Labels of varying complexity
- Different model architectures
- Cross-domain transfer scenarios


#### 4.1.3 Margin-Based Confidence: Decision Boundary Analysis

**Basic Margin:**

$$
\text{Margin}(x) = \log P(l_{\text{top1}} | x) - \log P(l_{\text{top2}} | x)
$$

**Generalized k-Margin:**

$$
\text{k-Margin}(x) = \log P(l_{\text{top1}} | x) - \frac{1}{k-1}\sum_{i=2}^{k} \log P(l_{\text{topi}} | x)
$$

**Theoretical Foundation:**
Connected to large-margin principle in statistical learning theory. Larger margins indicate:

- Greater separation between classes
- More robust predictions to small perturbations
- Lower generalization error bounds

**Practical Applications:**

- **Triage Systems:** Flag uncertain predictions for human review
- **Active Learning:** Select samples near decision boundaries
- **Confidence Calibration:** Use as input to calibration models


#### 4.1.4 Entropy-Based Uncertainty Quantification

**Shannon Entropy:**

$$
H(p) = -\sum_{k=1}^{K} p_k \log p_k
$$

**Normalized Entropy:**

$$
H_{\text{norm}}(p) = \frac{H(p)}{\log K}
$$

**Conditional Entropy for Multi-Label:**
For dependent labels, use conditional entropy:

$$
H(Y_k | Y_{-k}) = -\sum_{y_{-k}} P(y_{-k}) \sum_{y_k} P(y_k | y_{-k}) \log P(y_k | y_{-k})
$$

**Implementation Considerations:**

- Numerical stability for very small probabilities
- Efficient computation for large label vocabularies
- Handling of edge cases (deterministic predictions)


### 4.2 Advanced Aggregation Methods

#### 4.2.1 Token-Level Aggregation: Fine-Grained Analysis

**Aggregation Strategies:**

1. **Mean Aggregation:**

$$
c_{\text{mean}} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} P(w_t | w_{<t}, x)
$$
2. **Minimum Aggregation (Bottleneck Detection):**

$$
c_{\text{min}} = \min_{t \in [1,T]} P(w_t | w_{<t}, x)
$$
3. **Geometric Mean:**

$$
c_{\text{geom}} = \left(\prod_{t=1}^{T} P(w_t | w_{<t}, x)\right)^{1/T}
$$
4. **Attention-Weighted:**

$$
c_{\text{att}} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha_t P(w_t | w_{<t}, x)
$$

where $\alpha_t$ are attention weights.

**Analysis Applications:**

- **Error Localization:** Identify specific tokens causing low confidence
- **Model Debugging:** Understand failure modes at sub-word level
- **Curriculum Learning:** Design training schedules based on token difficulty


#### 4.2.2 Voting and Ensemble Methods: Epistemic Uncertainty

**Monte Carlo Dropout:**
Enable dropout during inference to create stochastic predictions:

$$
c_{\text{MC}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbb{I}[\text{prediction}_m = \hat{y}]
$$

**Deep Ensemble:**
Train multiple models with different initializations:

$$
c_{\text{ensemble}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} P_m(y | x)
$$

**Variance-Based Uncertainty:**

$$
\text{Var}[P(y|x)] = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} P_m(y|x)^2 - \left(\frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} P_m(y|x)\right)^2
$$

**Temperature Scaling for Ensemble:**
Apply different temperatures to ensemble members:

$$
P_m(y|x) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{z_m}{T_m}\right)
$$

### 4.3 Meta-Cognitive and Self-Assessment Methods

#### 4.3.1 LLM-as-a-Judge: Self-Evaluation Framework

**Direct Confidence Prompting:**

```
Given your prediction "{prediction}" for the input "{text}", 
how confident are you on a scale of 0-100? 
Provide only the numerical confidence score.
```

**Reasoning-Based Assessment:**

```
Analyze your prediction "{prediction}" for "{text}". 
Consider: 1) Clarity of the text, 2) Ambiguity in classification, 
3) Similarity to training examples. 
Provide a confidence score (0-100) with brief reasoning.
```

**Calibration Techniques for Self-Assessment:**

- **Consistency Checking:** Ask multiple times with different phrasings
- **Reference Anchoring:** Provide examples of different confidence levels
- **Meta-Prompting:** Ask model to evaluate its own evaluation process

**Empirical Findings:**
Recent research shows:

- Self-assessed confidence correlates moderately (r=0.3-0.6) with actual accuracy
- Performance varies significantly across model scales and architectures
- Prompt engineering can improve calibration by 10-20% in ECE terms


#### 4.3.2 Memory and Retrieval-Based Methods

**Nearest Neighbor Confidence:**

$$
c_{\text{NN}} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \text{accuracy}(x_i)
$$

where $x_1, ..., x_k$ are the k-nearest neighbors in the training set.

**Prototype-Based Assessment:**

$$
c_{\text{proto}} = \max_p \text{similarity}(x, p) \cdot \text{reliability}(p)
$$

where prototypes $p$ are learned cluster centers with associated reliability scores.

**Dynamic Memory Update:**
Continuously update confidence based on recent predictions:

$$
c_t = \alpha \cdot c_{t-1} + (1-\alpha) \cdot \text{local\_accuracy}(x_t)
$$

### 4.4 Calibration and Post-Processing Methods

#### 4.4.1 Platt Scaling: Parametric Calibration

**Basic Formulation:**

$$
P_{\text{cal}}(y=1|s) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(As + B)}
$$

where $s$ is the uncalibrated score, and $A, B$ are learned parameters.

**Multi-Class Extension:**
For K classes, use multinomial logistic regression:

$$
P_{\text{cal}}(y=k|s) = \frac{\exp(A_k s + B_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(A_j s + B_j)}
$$

**Optimization Objective:**
Minimize negative log-likelihood on validation set:

$$
\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \log P_{\text{cal}}(y_i=1|s_i)
$$

**Advantages:**

- Simple parametric form
- Fast inference
- Theoretical guarantees under certain assumptions

**Limitations:**

- Assumes sigmoid relationship between scores and probabilities
- May not capture complex calibration curves
- Sensitive to outliers in calibration data


#### 4.4.2 Isotonic Regression: Non-Parametric Calibration

**Mathematical Framework:**
Find monotonic function \$f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \$ that minimizes:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - f(s_i))^2
$$

subject to $f(s_i) \leq f(s_j)$ whenever $s_i \leq s_j$.

**Pool Adjacent Violators Algorithm:**
Efficient algorithm for isotonic regression:

1. Start with unconstrained solution
2. Identify violations of monotonicity constraint
3. Pool adjacent points that violate constraint
4. Repeat until no violations remain

**Advantages:**

- No parametric assumptions
- Handles arbitrary monotonic relationships
- Robust to outliers

**Limitations:**

- Requires larger calibration datasets
- Can overfit with insufficient data
- May produce discontinuous calibration functions


#### 4.4.3 Temperature Scaling: Global Calibration

**Single Temperature Parameter:**

$$
P_{\text{cal}}(y|x) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{z}{T}\right)
$$

where $z$ are logits and $T > 0$ is the temperature parameter.

**Learning Temperature:**
Minimize negative log-likelihood on validation set:

$$
T^* = \arg\min_T -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \log P_{\text{cal}}(y_i | x_i, T)
$$

**Multi-Temperature Extension:**
Different temperatures for different classes:

$$
P_{\text{cal}}(y=k|x) = \frac{\exp(z_k/T_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(z_j/T_j)}
$$

**Theoretical Properties:**

- Preserves ranking of predictions
- Simple and fast to apply
- Provably optimal for certain loss functions

## 5. Quantitative Metrics and Statistical Evaluation Criteria

### 5.1 Correlation Analysis: Fundamental Relationships

#### 5.1.1 Pearson Product-Moment Correlation

**Mathematical Definition:**

$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(c_i - \bar{c})(a_i - \bar{a})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(c_i - \bar{c})^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_i - \bar{a})^2}}
$$

where $c_i$ are confidence scores, $a_i$ are agreement labels, and $\bar{c}, \bar{a}$ are respective means.

**Interpretation Guidelines:**

- **r > 0.7:** Strong positive correlation, good confidence-accuracy alignment
- **0.3 < r < 0.7:** Moderate correlation, room for improvement
- **r < 0.3:** Weak correlation, confidence scores may be unreliable

**Statistical Significance Testing:**
Test null hypothesis $H_0: \rho = 0$ using t-statistic:

$$
t = \frac{r\sqrt{n-2}}{\sqrt{1-r^2}} \sim t_{n-2}
$$

**Assumptions and Limitations:**

- Assumes linear relationship between variables
- Sensitive to outliers and extreme values
- May miss monotonic but non-linear relationships


#### 5.1.2 Spearman Rank Correlation

**Definition:**

$$
\rho_s = 1 - \frac{6\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}
$$

where $d_i$ is the difference between ranks of $c_i$ and $a_i$.

**Advantages over Pearson:**

- Robust to outliers and non-normal distributions
- Captures monotonic relationships regardless of functional form
- No assumptions about underlying distributions

**When to Use:**

- Non-linear but monotonic confidence-accuracy relationships
- Presence of extreme outliers in the data
- Ordinal rather than continuous confidence scores


#### 5.1.3 Advanced Correlation Measures

**Kendall's Tau:**
More robust for small samples:

$$
\tau = \frac{(\text{number of concordant pairs}) - (\text{number of discordant pairs})}{\binom{n}{2}}
$$

**Distance Correlation:**
Captures non-monotonic dependencies:

$$
\text{dCor}(X,Y) = \frac{\text{dCov}(X,Y)}{\sqrt{\text{dCov}(X,X) \cdot \text{dCov}(Y,Y)}}
$$

### 5.2 Calibration Metrics: Reliability Assessment

#### 5.2.1 Expected Calibration Error (ECE): The Gold Standard

**Formal Definition:**

$$
\text{ECE} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \frac{|B_m|}{n} |\text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m)|
$$

where:

- $B_m$ is the set of samples in confidence bin $m$
- $\text{acc}(B_m) = \frac{1}{|B_m|} \sum_{i \in B_m} a_i$ is empirical accuracy in bin $m$
- $\text{conf}(B_m) = \frac{1}{|B_m|} \sum_{i \in B_m} c_i$ is average confidence in bin $m$

**Binning Strategies:**

1. **Equal Width Binning:**
    - Divide  into M equal intervals
    - Simple but may have empty bins or extreme imbalance
2. **Equal Frequency Binning:**
    - Each bin contains approximately n/M samples
    - Better statistical power but non-uniform confidence ranges
3. **Adaptive Binning:**
    - Use decision trees or other methods to create bins
    - Optimize for statistical significance within bins

**Statistical Properties:**

- **Consistency:** ECE → true calibration error as n → ∞
- **Bias:** Slight downward bias for finite samples
- **Variance:** Decreases with sample size and number of bins

**Confidence Intervals:**
Bootstrap confidence intervals for ECE:

$$
\text{ECE}_{CI} = \left[\text{ECE}_{(B \cdot \alpha/2)}, \text{ECE}_{(B \cdot (1-\alpha/2))}\right]
$$

where B is the number of bootstrap samples.

#### 5.2.2 Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)

**Definition:**

$$
\text{MCE} = \max_{m \in \{1,...,M\}} |\text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m)|
$$

**Interpretation:**

- Identifies the worst-calibrated confidence region
- More sensitive to extreme miscalibration than ECE
- Useful for risk assessment in safety-critical applications

**Relationship to ECE:**
MCE provides an upper bound on local calibration error, while ECE gives the average. Both metrics together provide a complete picture of calibration quality.

#### 5.2.3 Brier Score: Comprehensive Reliability Measure

**Mathematical Formulation:**

$$
\text{BS} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (c_i - a_i)^2
$$

**Decomposition (Murphy, 1973):**

$$
\text{BS} = \text{Reliability} - \text{Resolution} + \text{Uncertainty}
$$

where:

- **Reliability:** $\sum_{k=1}^{K} n_k (\bar{c}_k - \bar{a}_k)^2 / N$ (calibration quality)
- **Resolution:** $\sum_{k=1}^{K} n_k (\bar{a}_k - \bar{a})^2 / N$ (discrimination ability)
- **Uncertainty:** $\bar{a}(1 - \bar{a})$ (inherent predictability)

**Interpretation:**

- Lower Brier Score indicates better overall performance
- Reliability component should be minimized (better calibration)
- Resolution component should be maximized (better discrimination)

**Multi-Label Extension:**

$$
\text{BS}_{\text{multi}} = \frac{1}{N \cdot K} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} (c_{ik} - a_{ik})^2
$$

### 5.3 Discrimination Metrics: Separation Analysis

#### 5.3.1 Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Analysis

**ROC Curve Construction:**
For varying threshold τ:

- **True Positive Rate:** $\text{TPR}(\tau) = \frac{\text{TP}(\tau)}{\text{TP}(\tau) + \text{FN}(\tau)}$
- **False Positive Rate:** $\text{FPR}(\tau) = \frac{\text{FP}(\tau)}{\text{FP}(\tau) + \text{TN}(\tau)}$

**Area Under Curve (AUC):**

$$
\text{AUC} = \int_0^1 \text{TPR}(\text{FPR}^{-1}(x)) dx
$$

**Probabilistic Interpretation:**
AUC equals the probability that a randomly chosen positive example has higher confidence than a randomly chosen negative example.

**Multi-Label ROC:**
For multi-label scenarios, compute:

1. **Micro-averaged AUC:** Pool all label-instance pairs
2. **Macro-averaged AUC:** Average AUC across individual labels
3. **Sample-averaged AUC:** Average AUC across samples

#### 5.3.2 Precision-Recall Analysis

**Precision-Recall Curve:**

- **Precision:** $P(\tau) = \frac{\text{TP}(\tau)}{\text{TP}(\tau) + \text{FP}(\tau)}$
- **Recall:** $R(\tau) = \frac{\text{TP}(\tau)}{\text{TP}(\tau) + \text{FN}(\tau)}$

**Average Precision (AP):**

$$
\text{AP} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} [R(k) - R(k-1)] P(k)
$$

**When to Use:**

- Imbalanced datasets where negative class dominates
- Applications where precision is more important than specificity
- Multi-label scenarios with varying label frequencies


#### 5.3.3 Advanced Discrimination Measures

**Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic:**
Maximum difference between cumulative distributions:

$$
\text{KS} = \max_{\tau} |\text{CDF}_{\text{pos}}(\tau) - \text{CDF}_{\text{neg}}(\tau)|
$$

**Mann-Whitney U Statistic:**
Non-parametric test for difference in distributions:

$$
U = \sum_{i=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j=1}^{n_2} \mathbb{I}[X_i > Y_j]
$$

### 5.4 Coverage and Risk Analysis

#### 5.4.1 Risk Function

$$
R(\tau) = \frac{\sum_{i: c_i \geq \tau} (1 - a_i)}{\sum_{i: c_i \geq \tau} 1}
$$

**Coverage Function:**

$$
C(\tau) = \frac{|\{i: c_i \geq \tau\}|}{N}
$$

**Optimal Threshold Selection:**
Find τ* that minimizes risk-coverage trade-off:

$$
\tau^* = \arg\min_\tau \lambda R(\tau) + (1-\lambda)(1-C(\tau))
$$

where λ balances risk aversion vs. coverage maximization.

#### 5.4.2 Selective Prediction Theory

**Area Under Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC):**

$$
\text{AURC} = \int_0^1 R(C^{-1}(c)) dc
$$

Lower AURC indicates better selective prediction performance.

**Excess Area Under Risk-Coverage Curve (E-AURC):**
Compare to oracle performance:

$$
\text{E-AURC} = \text{AURC} - \text{AURC}_{\text{oracle}}
$$

## 6. Visualization Approaches for Confidence Analysis

### 6.1 Distribution Analysis Plots

#### 6.1.1 Boxplots for Agreement/Disagreement Cases

**Design Specifications:**
Side-by-side boxplots showing confidence score distributions for agreement=1, agreement=0, and partial agreement cases.

**Interpretation Guidelines:**

- **Good Separation:** Minimal overlap between correct/incorrect confidence distributions

- **Confidence Intervals:** Show uncertainty in bin accuracy estimates
- **Bin Sizes:** Use marker size or color to indicate sample sizes
- **Calibration Metrics:** Annotate plot with ECE and MCE values
- **Comparison Lines:** Show perfect calibration and random baseline


#### 6.2.2 Calibration Bands and Statistical Significance

**Confidence Bands for Perfect Calibration:**
Under null hypothesis of perfect calibration, construct simultaneous confidence bands:

$$
\text{Band}(\alpha) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{\log(2/\alpha)}{2n}}
$$

### 6.3 Multi-Dimensional Analysis

#### 6.3.1 Heatmaps: Correlation and Pattern Analysis

**Label-Wise Calibration Heatmap:**
Matrix showing calibration across different labels with confidence bins.

**Class Imbalance Visualization:**

- Color intensity represents sample sizes
- Separate heatmaps for different data subsets


#### 6.3.2 Risk-Coverage Curves: Operational Decision Support

**Interpretation Guidelines:**
