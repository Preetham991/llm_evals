## 2. Theoretical Foundations of Confidence Evaluation

### 2.1 Mathematical Framework

#### 2.1.1 Formal Problem Definition

Let $X$ be the input space (emails/documents), $Y = \{0,1\}^K$ be the multi-label output space for $K$ labels, and $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be our LLM classifier. For each input $x_i$, the model produces:

- **Predicted labels:** $\hat{y}_i = [\hat{y}_{i1}, ..., \hat{y}_{iK}]$ where $\hat{y}_{ik} \in \{0,1\}$
- **Raw scores:** $s_i = [s_{i1}, ..., s_{iK}]$ where $s_{ik} \in \mathbb{R}$
- **Confidence scores:** $c_i = [c_{i1}, ..., c_{iK}]$ where \$c_{ik} \in \$[^1]

The fundamental goal is to ensure that $c_{ik}$ accurately reflects $P(\hat{y}_{ik} = y_{ik})$, the probability that the predicted label matches the true label.

**Theoretical Expansion:** This setup assumes a probabilistic interpretation of outputs, often via sigmoid on logits for multi-label (independent labels) or softmax for multi-class. In multi-label, unlike multi-class, labels are not mutually exclusive, so independence assumptions may not hold, leading to joint probability models (Zhang \& Zhou, 2014). For LLMs, confidence often derives from token probabilities, adding sequence modeling complexity. Derivation: The probability $P(\hat{y}_{ik} = y_{ik})$ can be modeled as a Bernoulli, but in practice, it's estimated from validation data or model internals.

#### 2.1.2 Information-Theoretic Foundations

**Entropy and Uncertainty:**
The Shannon entropy of the predicted label distribution provides a natural measure of model uncertainty:

$$
H(p_i) = -\sum_{k=1}^{K} p_{ik} \log p_{ik}
$$

where $p_{ik}$ represents the probability assigned to label $k$ for sample $i$.

**Variable Breakdown in Formula:**

- $H(p_i)$: Entropy for sample i (scalar, unit: bits if log base 2, nats if natural log).
- $K$: Number of labels (fixed for the task).
- $p_{ik}$: Probability for label k in sample i (must sum to 1 over k if normalized; in multi-label, often sigmoid per-label so sum can exceed 1).
- $\log$: Logarithm (base 2 for information bits).

**Theoretical Expansion:** Entropy quantifies the average information needed to specify the outcome (Shannon, 1948). Derivation: From the definition of information as $-\log p$, averaged over the distribution. In multi-label, high entropy indicates conflicting label signals (e.g., an email that could be "Spam" or "Promotion"). Normalized entropy $H / \log K$ bounds it to  for comparison across tasks with different K. Limitations: Assumes independence; for correlated labels, use conditional entropy. In LLMs, entropy can be computed over token sequences for generative outputs.[^1]

**Mutual Information:**
The relationship between model predictions and true labels can be quantified through mutual information:

$$
I(Y; \hat{Y}) = \sum_{y,\hat{y}} P(y,\hat{y}) \log \frac{P(y,\hat{y})}{P(y)P(\hat{y})}
$$

**Variable Breakdown in Formula:**

- $I(Y; \hat{Y})$: Mutual information (scalar, measures dependence in bits).
- $y, \hat{y}$: Possible true and predicted label vectors (from $Y$).
- $P(y,\hat{y})$: Joint probability of true and predicted.
- $P(y), P(\hat{y})$: Marginal probabilities.
- $\log$: Logarithm (base 2).

**Theoretical Expansion:** MI measures how much knowing predictions reduces uncertainty about true labels (Cover \& Thomas, 1991). Derivation: $I = H(Y) - H(Y|\hat{Y})$, the reduction in entropy. In multi-label, it's useful for detecting label dependencies; high MI indicates good predictive power. Computationally, estimate via empirical distributions or approximations for high K. For LLMs, MI can assess how much token-level uncertainty contributes to label uncertainty.

#### 2.1.3 Proper Scoring Rules

Confidence evaluation relies heavily on proper scoring rules, which provide unbiased estimates of predictive quality. A scoring rule $S(p, y)$ is proper if it is maximized in expectation when $p$ equals the true probability distribution.

**Key Properties:**

- **Incentive Compatibility:** Optimal strategy is to report true beliefs.
- **Decomposability:** Can be analyzed in terms of calibration and sharpness.
- **Strict Properness:** Unique maximum at true probability.

**Theoretical Expansion:** Proper rules ensure that models are incentivized to output calibrated probabilities (Gneiting \& Raftery, 2007). Derivation: A rule is proper if \$ \mathbb{E}_{y \sim q} [S(p, y)] \leq \mathbb{E}_{y \sim q} [S(q, y)] \$ for all distributions q, with equality iff p=q. In multi-label, extend to multivariate rules (e.g., energy scores for joint distributions). Examples include Brier (quadratic) and logarithmic scoring, both proper but with different sensitivities (Brier penalizes less harshly than log). For LLMs, proper rules help evaluate generative probabilities.

### 2.2 Calibration Theory

#### 2.2.1 Perfect Calibration Definition

A confidence function \$c: X \rightarrow \$ is perfectly calibrated if:[^1]

$$
P(Y = 1 | c(X) = p) = p \quad \forall p \in [^1]
$$

This means that among all predictions with confidence $p$, exactly proportion $p$ should be correct.

**Variable Breakdown in Formula:**

- $P(Y = 1 | c(X) = p)$: Conditional probability that the true outcome Y is 1 given confidence p.
- $Y$: True binary outcome (1=correct).
- $c(X)$: Confidence function output for input X.
- $p$: Specific confidence value in.[^1]

**Theoretical Expansion:** Perfect calibration is a frequentist property, ensuring long-run frequency matches probability (Dawid, 1982). Derivation: From the law of total expectation, integrating over p. In multi-label, marginal calibration (per-label) is easier than joint (all labels simultaneously), but joint is needed for correlated tags like "Spam" and "Phishing" (Kull et al., 2017). Limitations: Doesn't guarantee sharpness (confidences close to 0.5 are calibrated but uninformative). For LLMs, calibration can be assessed at token or label level.

#### 2.2.2 Reliability-Resolution-Uncertainty Decomposition

The Brier score can be decomposed as:

$$
BS = \text{Reliability} - \text{Resolution} + \text{Uncertainty}
$$

where:

- **Reliability:** Measures calibration quality (lower is better).
- **Resolution:** Measures ability to discriminate (higher is better).
- **Uncertainty:** Inherent difficulty of the prediction task.

**Variable Breakdown in Formula:**

- $BS$: Brier score (scalar).
- Reliability: Sum of squared differences between bin accuracy and confidence.
- Resolution: Variance of bin accuracies.
- Uncertainty: Variance of overall accuracy.

**Theoretical Expansion:** This decomposition (Murphy, 1973) separates sources of error. Derivation: From variance decomposition of expected squared error. In multi-label, apply per-label or jointly; high uncertainty in emails may stem from ambiguous text, while low resolution indicates poor model discrimination (Bröcker \& Smith, 2007). For LLMs, decomposition helps diagnose if poor confidence stems from generative uncertainty.

#### 2.2.3 Multi-Label Calibration Challenges

Multi-label scenarios introduce additional complexity:

1. **Label Dependencies:** Labels may be correlated, violating independence assumptions.
2. **Marginal vs. Joint Calibration:** Individual label calibration may not ensure joint calibration.
3. **Class Imbalance:** Rare labels may have insufficient data for reliable calibration.

**Theoretical Expansion:** Dependencies require modeling label correlations (e.g., via chain classifiers or label powerset); imbalance can bias calibration toward majority labels (Tsoumakas \& Katakis, 2007). Derivation: Joint calibration follows from multivariate probability calibration. Solutions include weighted binning or multi-output calibration methods. In LLMs, challenges amplify due to sequence generation.

### 2.3 Uncertainty Quantification Framework

#### 2.3.1 Types of Uncertainty

**Aleatoric Uncertainty (Data Uncertainty):**

- Inherent noise in the data.
- Cannot be reduced with more data.
- Captured through distributional modeling.

**Epistemic Uncertainty (Model Uncertainty):**

- Uncertainty due to limited training data.
- Can potentially be reduced with more data.
- Captured through ensemble methods or Bayesian approaches.

**Theoretical Expansion:** Aleatoric is irreducible (e.g., noisy email labels), epistemic is reducible (e.g., more training data). In multi-label, decompose per-label or jointly (Smith \& Gal, 2018). Derivation: From total variance decomposition: Var = Aleatoric + Epistemic.

#### 2.3.2 Bayesian Perspective

From a Bayesian viewpoint, confidence should reflect the posterior probability:

$$
P(y|x, \mathcal{D}) = \int P(y|x, \theta) P(\theta|\mathcal{D}) d\theta
$$

where $\theta$ represents model parameters and $\mathcal{D}$ is the training data.

**Variable Breakdown in Formula:**

- $P(y|x, \mathcal{D})$: Posterior probability of label y given input x and data \mathcal{D}.
- $P(y|x, \theta)$: Likelihood under parameters \theta.
- $P(\theta|\mathcal{D})$: Posterior over parameters.
- $\int ... d\theta$: Integral over parameter space.

**Theoretical Expansion:** Bayesian methods provide full posterior distributions for uncertainty (MacKay, 1992). Derivation: From Bayes' theorem, $P(\theta|\mathcal{D}) \propto P(\mathcal{D}|\theta) P(\theta)$. Approximations like variational inference or MC-Dropout are common in LLMs (Blundell et al., 2015); in multi-label, extend to Bayesian networks for label dependencies.

## 3. Agreement Labels: The Foundation of Empirical Evaluation

### 3.1 Binary Agreement (Ground Truth vs Prediction)

#### 3.1.1 Formal Definition and Properties

For each predicted label $l_k$ on sample $i$, the binary agreement signal is:

$$
a_{ik} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \hat{y}_{ik} = y_{ik} \text{ (exact match)} \\
0 & \text{if } \hat{y}_{ik} \neq y_{ik} \text{ (disagreement)}
\end{cases}
$$

**Mathematical Properties:**

- **Deterministic:** Each prediction has a definite correct/incorrect status.
- **Symmetric:** All errors are weighted equally regardless of label or context.
- **Transitive:** Agreement with ground truth implies consistency across evaluators.

**Theoretical Expansion:** Binary agreement is a Bernoulli indicator, enabling probabilistic modeling. In multi-label, aggregate as Hamming loss for sample-level error.

#### 3.1.2 Theoretical Foundations

Binary agreement serves as the foundation for proper scoring rules, calibration analysis, discrimination metrics, and statistical inference. It assumes a single ground truth, which may not hold in subjective tasks.

#### 3.1.3 Implementation Considerations

**Data Quality Requirements:** Clean labels, consistent protocols.
**Computational Efficiency:** O(1) per prediction.

#### 3.1.4 Use Cases and Applications

Ideal for regulatory compliance and benchmarks; limitations in capturing uncertainty.

### 3.2 Partial/Soft Agreement (Annotator Consensus)

#### 3.2.1 Mathematical Formulation

$$
a_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{J} \mathbb{I}[\text{annotator}_j \text{ agrees with prediction}]}{J}
$$

**Generalized Weighting:**

$$
a_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{J} w_j \cdot \mathbb{I}[\text{annotator}_j \text{ agrees with prediction}]}{\sum_{j=1}^{J} w_j}
$$

**Theoretical Advantages:** Noise robustness, stable estimates.

#### 3.2.2 Theoretical Foundations

Addresses label noise; connects to crowd-sourcing models.

#### 3.2.3 Implementation Considerations

Minimum 3-5 annotators; use probabilistic aggregation.

#### 3.2.4 Use Cases and Applications

For subjective tasks; limitations in cost.

### 3.3 Integration in Evaluation Pipeline

**Preprocessing:** Validation, normalization.
**Metric Adaptation:** Extend to soft targets.
**Visualization:** Gradients for partial values.
**Theoretical Justification:** Dual systems for complete performance view.

## 5. Quantitative Metrics and Statistical Evaluation Criteria (Expanded with In-Depth Explanations)

This section provides an in-depth explanation of each metric, including the full formula, a breakdown of every variable used (with consistent notation across the document), theoretical background, interpretation, strengths/weaknesses, and when/why to use it. Variables are standardized:

- $N$: Total number of instances (e.g., (sample, label) pairs).
- $K$: Number of classes/labels.
- $i$: Index over instances, $i\in\{1,\dots,N\}$.
- $c_i\in$: Confidence score for instance i.[^1]
- $y_i\in\{0,1\}$: True binary outcome for instance i (1=correct, 0=incorrect).
- $M$: Number of bins.
- $B_m$: Set of instances whose $c_i$ fall into bin m.
- $\bar{c}$: Mean confidence.
- Other variables defined per metric.


### 5.1 Expected Calibration Error (ECE)

**Theoretical Background:** ECE measures how well the model's confidence scores align with empirical accuracy, binning scores to check if, e.g., predictions with 0.8 confidence are correct 80% of the time. Originated from Guo et al. (2017) for neural network calibration; in multi-label, it's often computed per-label or micro-averaged to handle imbalances. It approximates the continuous calibration error by discretizing into bins.

**Full Formula:**

$$
\text{ECE} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \frac{|B_m|}{N} \left| \text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m) \right|
$$

**Variable Breakdown:**

- $M$: Number of bins (e.g., 10 for deciles; user-defined, typically 10-20 for balance between granularity and statistical power).
- $B_m$: Set of instances i where $c_i$ falls in bin m (e.g., bin 1: [0,0.1), bin 2: [0.1,0.2), etc.).
- $|B_m|$: Number of instances in bin m.
- $N$: Total instances (300 in our dummy dataset).
- $\text{acc}(B_m) = \frac{1}{|B_m|} \sum_{i \in B_m} y_i$: Average correctness in bin m.
- $\text{conf}(B_m) = \frac{1}{|B_m|} \sum_{i \in B_m} c_i$: Average confidence in bin m.

**Interpretation:** ECE=0 means perfect calibration; >0.1 indicates miscalibration (over/under-confidence). In multi-label, high ECE may signal label dependency issues.

**Strengths:** Intuitive, decomposable; works for any probabilistic output.
**Weaknesses:** Sensitive to binning choice; may underestimate in small samples.

**When/Why to Use:** Use ECE as the primary calibration check in any deployment where confidence is used for decision-making (e.g., auto-tagging emails with conf >0.7). Ideal for multi-label to detect per-class calibration bias; avoid if you only need ranking (use ROC-AUC instead).

### 5.2 Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)

**Theoretical Background:** MCE is the max deviation in any ECE bin, focusing on worst-case miscalibration. Extension of ECE for risk assessment; useful in safety-critical multi-label tasks where one bad bin could cause cascading errors (e.g., missing a "Spam" label). It addresses limitations of averaged ECE by highlighting outliers (Naeini et al., 2015).

**Full Formula:**

$$
\text{MCE} = \max_{m=1}^{M} \left| \text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m) \right|
$$

**Variable Breakdown:** Same as ECE (M, B_m, |B_m|, N, acc(B_m), conf(B_m)).

**Interpretation:** MCE=0 is perfect; >0.2 signals a risky confidence range. In multi-label, high MCE in one class may indicate data scarcity.

**Strengths:** Highlights critical failures; easy to bound risk.
**Weaknesses:** Ignores average performance; sensitive to small bins.

**When/Why to Use:** Use MCE in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., legal email classification) to identify and blacklist poorly calibrated confidence ranges. Choose over ECE when worst-case risk matters more than average; avoid for overall model comparison (use Brier instead).

### 5.3 Brier Score (BS)

**Theoretical Background:** Proper scoring rule measuring mean squared error between confidence and outcome (Brier, 1950). Decomposes into calibration, resolution, and uncertainty; in multi-label, it's often averaged per-label for imbalance handling. It's quadratic, so less sensitive to extremes than log-based rules.

**Full Formula:**

$$
\text{BS} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (c_i - y_i)^2
$$

**Variable Breakdown:**

- $N$: Total instances.
- $c_i$: Confidence for i (0-1).
- $y_i$: True outcome for i (1=correct, 0=incorrect).

**Interpretation:** 0=perfect; 0.25=random. Lower values indicate better calibration and sharpness.

**Strengths:** Decomposable; proper rule.
**Weaknesses:** Sensitive to class imbalance in multi-label.

**When/Why to Use:** Use Brier for overall probabilistic quality in balanced multi-label tasks (e.g., email tagging); it's decomposable for diagnosing issues. Choose over ECE for optimization during training; avoid in highly imbalanced cases (use weighted variant).

### 5.4 Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) / Log Loss

**Theoretical Background:** Measures the negative log-probability of true outcomes under the model's distribution; penalizes confident errors exponentially (Good, 1952). In multi-label, extend to per-label loss for independent assumptions. It's a proper scoring rule, infinitely penalizing certain errors (log0=−∞), making it sensitive to tails.

**Full Formula:**

$$
\text{NLL} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \log c_i + (1-y_i) \log(1-c_i)]
$$

**Variable Breakdown:**

- $N$: Total instances.
- $y_i$: True outcome (1/0).
- $c_i$: Confidence (must be in (0,1) to avoid log(0); add epsilon for stability).
- $\log$: Natural logarithm.

**Interpretation:** Lower=better; infinite for certain errors. Good for calibrated models.

**Strengths:** Proper, sensitive to tails.
**Weaknesses:** Undefined at 0/1; assumes independence in multi-label.

**When/Why to Use:** Use NLL during model training/optimization in multi-label tasks with probabilistic outputs (e.g., sigmoid per-label); it's the natural loss for calibration. Choose over Brier when overconfidence is the main concern; avoid if confidences are not strict probabilities.

### 5.5 ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)

**Theoretical Background:** Measures the model's ability to rank correct instances above incorrect ones across thresholds (Fawcett, 2006). In multi-label, use micro-averaging for overall performance or macro for per-class. It's the probability that a positive ranks above a negative.

**Full Formula:**

$$
\text{ROC-AUC} = \int_0^1 \text{TPR}(t) d\text{FPR}(t)
$$

**Variable Breakdown:**

- TPR(t) = True Positive Rate at threshold t = TP(t) / (TP(t) + FN(t)), where TP= true positives, FN= false negatives.
- FPR(t) = False Positive Rate at threshold t = FP(t) / (FP(t) + TN(t)), where FP= false positives, TN= true negatives.
- t: Threshold on c_i.

**Interpretation:** 1=perfect separation; 0.5=random. >0.8=strong.

**Strengths:** Threshold-independent; robust to imbalance.
**Weaknesses:** Doesn't reflect absolute calibration.

**When/Why to Use:** Use ROC-AUC to compare discrimination in multi-label tasks (e.g., ranking email tags); it's ideal for model selection. Choose when thresholds are set post-hoc; avoid if precision is key (use PR-AUC).

### 5.6 Precision-Recall AUC (PR-AUC)

**Theoretical Background:** Area under the Precision-Recall curve, focusing on positive class performance (Davis \& Goadrich, 2006). Better for imbalanced multi-label where positives are rare.

**Full Formula:**

$$
\text{PR-AUC} = \int_0^1 P(r) dr
$$

**Variable Breakdown:**

- P(r) = TP / (TP + FP) at recall r = TP / (TP + FN).
- r: Recall level.

**Interpretation:** 1=perfect; baseline=positive prevalence.

**Strengths:** Handles imbalance.
**Weaknesses:** Ignores negatives.

**When/Why to Use:** Use PR-AUC in multi-label with rare positives (e.g., "Spam" detection); choose over ROC when false positives are costly.

### 5.7 Cohen’s d (Effect Size)

**Theoretical Background:** Standardized mean difference between groups (Cohen, 1988). In confidence evaluation, groups are correct vs incorrect instances.

**Full Formula:**

$$
d = \frac{ \bar{c}_{y=1} - \bar{c}_{y=0} }{ \sqrt{ \frac{ \sigma_{y=1}^2 + \sigma_{y=0}^2 }{2} } }
$$

**Variable Breakdown:**

- $\bar{c}_{y=1}$: Mean c_i for y_i=1.
- $\bar{c}_{y=0}$: Mean c_i for y_i=0.
- $\sigma_{y=1}^2$: Variance of c_i for y_i=1.
- $\sigma_{y=0}^2$: Variance of c_i for y_i=0.

**Interpretation:** >0.8=large effect.

**Strengths:** Quantifies separation.
**Weaknesses:** Assumes normality.

**When/Why to Use:** Use to assess if confidence separates outcomes in multi-label; choose for triage design.

### 5.8 Point-Biserial Correlation (r_pb)

**Theoretical Background:** Correlation between binary (y_i) and continuous (c_i) variables; special case of Pearson (Cox, 1958).

**Full Formula:**

$$
r_{pb} = \frac{ \bar{c}_{y=1} - \bar{c}_{y=0} }{ \sigma_c } \sqrt{ \frac{ n_1 n_0 }{ N^2 } }
$$

**Variable Breakdown:**

- $\bar{c}_{y=1}, \bar{c}_{y=0}$: Means as above.
- $\sigma_c$: SD of all c_i.
- $n_1, n_0$: Counts of y_i=1 and 0.
- $N$: Total.

**Interpretation:** -1 to 1; >0.3=moderate.

**Strengths:** Simple association measure.
**Weaknesses:** Assumes linearity.

**When/Why to Use:** Use for quick check of confidence-accuracy link in multi-label; choose when binary outcome is key.

### 5.9 Margin

**Theoretical Background:** Gap between top two confidences per sample (Cortes \& Vapnik, 1995).

**Full Formula:**

$$
\text{Margin}_j = c_j^{(\text{top1})} - c_j^{(\text{top2})}
$$

(for sample j; top1/2 = highest two c across K labels).

**Variable Breakdown:**

- $c_j^{(\text{top1})}$: Highest c for sample j.
- $c_j^{(\text{top2})}$: Second-highest.

**Interpretation:** >0.2=decisive.

**Strengths:** Simple ambiguity flag.
**Weaknesses:** Ignores absolute levels.

**When/Why to Use:** Use for triage in multi-label; choose when identifying close calls is priority.

### 5.10 Entropy (H)

**Theoretical Background:** Measures prediction spread (Shannon, 1948).

**Full Formula:**

$$
H_j = -\sum_{k=1}^{K} p_{jk} \log p_{jk}
$$

**Variable Breakdown:**

- $H_j$: Entropy for sample j.
- $p_{jk}$: Normalized probability for label k in j (sum to 1).

**Interpretation:** 0= certain; log K= max confusion.

**Strengths:** Captures multi-label ambiguity.
**Weaknesses:** No direction (high/low conf).

**When/Why to Use:** Use to flag uncertain samples in multi-label; choose for active learning.

### 5.11 Mutual Information (MI)

**Theoretical Background:** Disentangles epistemic uncertainty via ensembles (Depeweg et al., 2018).

**Full Formula:**

$$
\text{MI}_j = H[\mathbb{E}_w p(y| x_j,w)] - \mathbb{E}_w H[p(y| x_j,w)]
$$

**Variable Breakdown:**

- $\text{MI}_j$: MI for sample j.
- $w$: Model weights (e.g., from dropout).
- $p(y|x_j,w)$: Label prob under w.
- $H[\cdot]$: Entropy.

**Interpretation:** High= model unsure.

**Strengths:** Separates uncertainty types.
**Weaknesses:** Requires ensembles.

**When/Why to Use:** Use in safety-critical multi-label for epistemic checks; choose when data shift is possible.

### 5.12 Coverage-Risk Curve (with AURC)

**Theoretical Background:** Trade-off curve for selective prediction (Geifman \& El-Yaniv, 2017).

**Full Formula:**

$$
R(\tau) = \frac{\sum_{i: c_i \ge \tau} (1-y_i)}{\sum_{i: c_i \ge \tau} 1}, \quad C(\tau) = \frac{\sum_{i: c_i \ge \tau} 1}{N}
$$

AURC = ∫ R dC.

**Variable Breakdown:**

- $R(\tau)$: Risk at threshold τ.
- $C(\tau)$: Coverage at τ.
- τ: Confidence threshold.

**Interpretation:** Low AURC= good selectivity.

**Strengths:** Operational.
**Weaknesses:** Threshold-dependent.

**When/Why to Use:** Use for automation thresholds in multi-label; choose to balance volume and error.

## 13. Expanded Results and Interpretations from Dummy Dataset (With Detailed Explanations and Selection Criteria)

This section provides an elaborate, in-depth analysis of the dummy dataset results, explaining what each metric value means, why it occurs, and how it informs selection criteria for methods, thresholds, and actions. Interpretations are grounded in theory and practical implications for multi-label email classification. Selection criteria are derived directly from the results, with rationale for choosing one metric/method over another.

### 13.1 Detailed Calibration Analysis

- **ECE (0.14):** This value indicates an average absolute gap of 14 percentage points between predicted confidence and empirical accuracy across bins. For instance, in bins where average confidence is 0.75, actual accuracy might be 0.61, showing overconfidence. Why this occurs: In multi-label tasks, label dependencies (e.g., "Spam" and "Personal" overlapping) can bias sigmoid outputs, leading to systematic errors (as per Tsoumakas \& Katakis, 2007). Interpretation: The model is moderately miscalibrated, which could lead to over-trusting high-confidence predictions in email tagging, potentially causing false positives (e.g., marking a work email as spam). Selection Criteria: Choose ECE over MCE when average performance matters for overall system trust; use temperature scaling (Section 4.4.3) as the fix since the miscalibration is global, not bin-specific—post-scaling ECE drops to 0.09, a 36% improvement, making it suitable for deployment where uniform calibration is needed.
- **MCE (0.25):** The maximum bin-wise gap is 0.25, occurring in the [0.4-0.5] confidence bin where accuracy is 0.55 but confidence averages 0.8. Why this occurs: Small bins with few samples can amplify noise, especially in imbalanced multi-label data where rare positive labels skew estimates (Davis \& Goadrich, 2006). Interpretation: This highlights a "risky zone" where the model is dangerously overconfident, potentially leading to errors in ambiguous emails (e.g., promotional content). Selection Criteria: Select MCE over ECE for safety-critical applications like legal email filtering, where worst-case risk must be bounded; based on this result, blacklist auto-tagging for confidences 0.4-0.5 and opt for isotonic regression (Section 4.4.2) instead of temperature scaling, as it handles non-monotonic patterns better—post-isotonic MCE=0.18.
- **Brier Score (0.12):** This low value reflects good overall probabilistic quality, with decomposition showing reliability=0.05 (decent calibration), resolution=0.18 (strong discrimination), and uncertainty=0.19 (inherent data noise). Why this occurs: The quadratic penalty in Brier favors models that avoid extreme errors, and our simulation's confidence spread (0.79 correct vs 0.43 incorrect) contributes to high resolution (Murphy, 1973). Interpretation: The score suggests the model is reliable for aggregate decisions but data uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous email text) limits perfection. Selection Criteria: Choose Brier over NLL when decomposition is needed to diagnose if poor performance is model-related (low resolution) or data-related (high uncertainty); here, high uncertainty points to gathering more diverse training emails rather than model tweaks.
- **NLL (0.39):** This moderate value indicates few high-confidence errors, as NLL exponentially penalizes them. Why this occurs: The log-based penalty amplifies overconfidence, but our simulation's lower confidences for incorrect predictions keep it low (Good, 1952). Interpretation: The model avoids "catastrophic" mistakes, making it safer for partial automation. Selection Criteria: Select NLL over Brier for training optimization in multi-label tasks, as it's differentiable and sensitive to tails; based on this, prioritize methods like Platt scaling (Section 4.4.1) for fine-tuning, since NLL<0.5 suggests the issue is calibration, not base accuracy.


### 13.2 Detailed Discrimination Analysis

- **ROC-AUC (0.83):** This high value means there's an 83% chance a correct label gets higher confidence than an incorrect one. Why this occurs: The wide gap in mean confidences (0.79 vs 0.43) enables good ranking, despite some overlap (Fawcett, 2006). Interpretation: The model excels at prioritizing reliable tags, useful for ranking email categories. Selection Criteria: Choose ROC-AUC over PR-AUC when classes are balanced and you need threshold-independent comparison; here, 0.83>0.8 threshold (scikit-learn benchmark) justifies using global thresholds for automation, preferring it over Cohen's d for large N.
- **PR-AUC (0.76):** Precision remains solid as recall increases, with value above baseline prevalence (~0.4). Why this occurs: High precision in high-confidence regions compensates for imbalance in rare labels (Davis \& Goadrich, 2006). Interpretation: Effective for tasks where false positives are costly (e.g., mis-tagging personal emails). Selection Criteria: Select PR-AUC over ROC-AUC in imbalanced multi-label (positive rate<50%); this result (0.76>0.7) supports using it for precision-focused selection, like choosing token aggregation (Section 4.2.1) over simple logprobs for generative LLMs.
- **Cohen’s d (1.4):** The standardized mean difference is large, with correct confidences 1.4 SD above incorrect. Why this occurs: Simulation enforced the gap, but real variance ($\sigma_{y=1}=0.1, \sigma_{y=0}=0.15$) keeps it realistic (Cohen, 1988). Interpretation: Strong separation enables simple thresholding. Selection Criteria: Choose Cohen's d over r_pb when normality holds and you need effect size for reporting; 1.4>1.2 "very large" benchmark suggests margin-based methods (Section 4.1.3) for triage, as the gap supports binary decisions.
- **Point-Biserial (0.36):** Moderate correlation between confidence and correctness. Why this occurs: Linear assumption fits the data's monotonic trend, but non-linearities (e.g., overconfidence clusters) cap it (Cox, 1958). Interpretation: Confidence predicts accuracy reasonably but not perfectly. Selection Criteria: Select point-biserial over Spearman for linear assumptions in small N; 0.36>0.3 threshold indicates Spearman for non-linear checks, guiding choice of non-parametric calibration like isotonic.


### 13.3 Detailed Uncertainty Analysis

- **Margin (mean 0.22):** Average top1-top2 gap is moderate; 32% errors have margin<0.1. Why this occurs: Simulation's noise creates close calls, mimicking real multi-label ambiguity (Cortes \& Vapnik, 1995). Interpretation: Many predictions are "borderline," risking flips. Selection Criteria: Choose margin over entropy when per-sample decisiveness is key; 0.22<0.3 suggests hybrid triage with entropy for better coverage.
- **Entropy (mean 0.95):** Mild spread across labels. Why this occurs: Normalized to [0, log3≈1.1], 0.95 indicates some but not max confusion (Shannon, 1948). Interpretation: Model hesitates on overlapping tags. Selection Criteria: Select entropy over MI for aleatoric uncertainty; mean<1.0 supports using it for active learning selection, preferring over margin for joint-label tasks.
- **Mutual Information (0.18):** Low epistemic uncertainty. Why this occurs: Ensemble variance is small in simulation (Depeweg et al., 2018). Interpretation: Errors are data-driven, not model-driven. Selection Criteria: Choose MI over entropy when distinguishing uncertainty types; low value<0.2 suggests skipping ensembles, opting for data augmentation instead.


### 13.4 Detailed Selective Prediction Analysis

- **Coverage@0.7 (62%, risk=0.08):** 62% of pairs can be auto-tagged with 8% error. Why this occurs: High discrimination concentrates low-risk in high conf (Geifman \& El-Yaniv, 2017). Interpretation: Efficient for partial automation. Selection Criteria: Choose coverage-risk over AURC for threshold setting; 62%>50% supports temperature scaling to push more into high-conf.
- **AURC (0.18):** Low area under risk-coverage curve. Why this occurs: Steep initial drop from good ranking. Interpretation: Strong selective performance. Selection Criteria: Select AURC for overall selectivity; 0.18<0.2 benchmark favors it over ECE for deployment decisions.


### 13.5 Expanded Selection Criteria Based on Results

Based on these results, here's how to choose metrics/methods:

- **If ECE=0.14 (>0.1) and MCE=0.25 (>0.2):** Prioritize calibration metrics for deployment; select temperature scaling (simple, global) over isotonic (more flexible but data-hungry), as the miscalibration is uniform.
- **If ROC-AUC=0.83 (>0.8) but PR-AUC=0.76 (moderate):** Use discrimination metrics for model selection; choose PR-AUC over ROC in imbalanced cases like Class B, guiding preference for methods like ensemble voting to boost precision.
- **If Cohen’s d=1.4 (large) and r_pb=0.36 (moderate):** Opt for separation metrics like d for triage design; select over correlation when variance differs between groups, favoring margin-based triage.
- **If Margin=0.22 (moderate) and Entropy=0.95 (mild):** Choose uncertainty metrics for flagging; use entropy over margin for joint-label ambiguity, as results show entropy better predicts errors (40% rate at high entropy).
- **If MI=0.18 (low):** Select MI for epistemic checks; low value means avoid costly ensembles, choosing data-focused methods like memory-based instead.
- **If Coverage@0.7=62% at risk=0.08 and AURC=0.18 (good):** Use selective metrics for automation; choose coverage-risk over AURC for threshold tuning, as it directly informs SLAs—results support 0.7 as optimal.

These criteria are derived from benchmarks (e.g., ECE<0.1 "good" from Guo et al., 2017) and the specific patterns in our dummy data (e.g., high d supports simple thresholds).
